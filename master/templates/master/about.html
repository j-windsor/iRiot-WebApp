<h1>About <i>i</i>Riot.</h1>
<h3>The Internet of Things has been reinvented.</h3>

<p>In terms of existing products, <i>i</i>Riot is a mix between a traditional Internet of Things (IoT) appliance and a universal remote. It acts as an Internet-connected delegate to Infrared (IR) devices through acting as a universal remote to these devices. IR is the industry standard communications medium for remote control. The standard of IR communication is a 940 nanometer wavelength of light, which is invisible to the human eye, but can be seen by some cameras and some special IR sensors in all IR enabled devices. IR sensors are designed to produce a voltage if the incoming light is a 38 kHz pulse width modulated signal. Therefore, a “1” can be sent to the sensor by sending a 38 kHz square wave, and a “0” can be sent by sending no light. Our project will take advantage of this simple protocol and merge it with the world of IoT to achieve simple but effective home control.</p>
<p>We all want to have easy control over our homes without spending the time and money necessary to build a totally integrated smart home. Companies such as Alarm.com have tried with some success to enter the smart home market, but its products are expensive to purchase and maintain. Instead of making our own line of smart components such as Internet connected thermostats and TVs, we recognize that many devices we want to control can already be controlled through IR as they are with a universal remote. Devices such as entertainment equipment, some light switches, motorized window blinds, and air conditioning units already have this capability, and can be bought at a lower cost than their Wi-Fi enabled counterparts.</p>
<p>Our project also solves some security vulnerabilities generally associated with IoT technologies as well. Existing IoT solutions have smart home components which directly connect to the institutional or residential wireless Internet connection. However, connecting every light switch in a building to the wireless network and to the Internet provides additional points of entry for cyber-attacks and puts pressure on the network. Through <i>i</i>Riot, we will reduce the number of connected devices in the home, and therefore reduce the attack surface. In addition, we will communicate with the device over SSL using unique encryption keys for every device. In the world of IoT, manufacturers have little interest in security to keep the form and cost of its device to a minimum, but we will take security seriously.</p>
<p>The bulk of the project is an Internet-connected dome which serves as an IR blaster to control existing IR controlled products. The dome will contain an Internet-connected microcontroller (the Texas Instruments CC3200) at its core. It will interface via the MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, a commonly used IoT push protocol, with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT service. Users may login to a web app built using the Python Django Web Framework to manage hubs and control devices. The web app will interface with AWS IoT though a REST API, and pass basic information such as the IR code and the transmitting hub. AWS IoT maintains the MQTT connection with all the hubs, and pushes the IR code to the desired hubs. The hub receives and interprets the IR code and broadcasts the desired command to an IR enabled device to fulfill a task (i.e. turning off the lights or opening the blinds). The system can control any IR device within Line of Sight (LoS) of the dome.</p>
